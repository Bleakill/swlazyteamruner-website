        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to SWLazyTeam ("us", "we", or "our") which operates the website swlazyteamruner.com (the "Site") and the Lazy Team Runer software (the "Software"). This policy describes how we handle information specifically related to the delivery of software license keys via email.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information We Collect via Patreon</h3>
        <p>
            When you become a supporter of our project on Patreon and are eligible for a Software license key, Patreon provides us with information necessary to fulfill this, which typically includes the email address associated with your Patreon account.
        </p>

        <h3>3. How We Use Your Email Address</h3>
        <p>
            We use the email address provided by Patreon solely for the following transactional purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To deliver your unique license key for the Lazy Team Runer Software.</li>
            <li>To send essential notifications directly related to your license key or access status (e.g., confirmation of delivery, significant changes affecting your license).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not use this email address for marketing or promotional purposes unless you explicitly opt-in elsewhere.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Email Service Provider</h3>
        <p>
            To send these transactional emails, we utilize the services of MailerSend. When we send you an email, your email address is processed by MailerSend according to their terms and privacy policy. We only provide MailerSend with the necessary information (your email address) to deliver the license key email.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your email address obtained via Patreon for license delivery to outside parties, other than our email service provider (MailerSend) as necessary to deliver the email to you.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided to us, primarily by using reputable third-party services (Patreon for supporter information, MailerSend for email delivery, and secure database practices for license key management).
        </p>

        <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
        <p>
            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your email address is used for license key delivery, please contact us via the methods listed on our <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>
